### Dockerlabs: Injection

I learned a couple of weeks ago about this website DockerLabs and decided to give it a try. For starters I downloaded a **Very Easy** box to get a nudge of what I will be getting myself into. This box was very straightforward with the injection and SSH password, however I did not expect the privilege escalation to be from abusing SUID but rather a sudo command or old binary abuse, which came as a nice surprise.

### Initial enumeration

As always I started with an nmap scan, the result was as follows.

```bash
Nmap scan report for 172.17.0.2
Host is up (0.0000070s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)

```

Inspecting the website I am greeted by a login page.

After making a quick login attempt using the credentials `admin:admin'` (notice the semicolon) I saw the following message.

![placeholder](/assets/img/dockerlabs/injection/dockerlabs-injection-sqli.png "SQL error message")

This implies that there may be an SQL injection in the login form. I copied the request to a file that I used to feed sqlmap.

While sqlmap fetched data, I attempted to login completing the query.

> name=admin&password=admin'+OR+'1'='1'--+-&submit=

Which redirected me to `/acceso_valido_dylan.php` which showed me the following credentials.

> Bienvenido Dylan! Has insertado correctamente tu contrase√±a: KJSDFG789FGSDF78

### First shell

I then attempted to login as dylan (using that password) through the SSH service enumerated before.

```bash
$ ssh dylan@172.17.0.2
The authenticity of host '172.17.0.2 (172.17.0.2)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

### Privilege escalation

I tried to enumerate on my own the privileges of dylan using sudo but it did not work.

```bash
dylan@563ef2c2ecf8:~$ sudo -l
-bash: sudo: command not found
dylan@563ef2c2ecf8:~$ 
```

I ended up using the classic Linpeas privilege escalation enumeration script to do the trick and noticed the following permission.

![placeholder](/assets/img/dockerlabs/injection/dockerlabs-injection-env-suid.png "env binary suid")

This indicated that the `env` binary had the **SUID** bit set on it.

After reading [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/), I noticed there was a technique to obtain root privileges.

I executed the following and obtained root.

```bash
$ env /bin/sh -p
# cd /root
# echo "No flag like hackthebox!"
```

Overall very fun box. Looking forward to do more from this website.
